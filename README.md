## I'm working on the styling here... mostly!

This is still a work in progress...

### Features completed
* Background now resized using jquery plugin
* Banner positioning fixed with a hack
* Menu dropdown added and should be working
* Container centered and scrolling properly
* Login page styled
* Create account page styled
* Slots page styled
* Builds page styled
* Dungeons page styled
* Characters page styled
* Sort dropdown implemented (menu dropdown method)
* Event create form styled
* Events page styled
* Event signup form styled

### To do
* Refactor background images to CSS gradients
* Move new dungeon/build/slot buttons to the top of the page
* Move project to / from /redditgw/

### Other features
* Edit Profile mockup page?
* Comment functionality on event details (popup on hover?)
* Create new event button needs to be somewhere (dropdown menu under events on nav bar?)
* Edit event button needs to be somewhere on the event if you're the owner of the event

### Other ideas...
* Change banner image?
* Change background image?
* Change container opacity to ~70%
