## I'm working on just the styling here!

This is still a work in progress...

### Features completed
* Login page complete
* Background now resizing differently (using jquery plugin)
* Banner positioning fixed with a hack
* Menu dropdown added and should be working (positioning may need to be tweaked)
* Container should be correctly centered now

### Features in progress
* Styling for builds
* Styling for characters
* Styling for create account
* Styling for dungeons
* Styling for event create
* Styling for events
* Styling for signup
* Styling for slots

### Other ideas...
* Change banner image?
* Change background image?
* Change colors?
