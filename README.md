# [rddt] Sign-ups
## I'm working on the styling here... mostly!

This is still a work in progress...

### Features completed
* New Google web font, refactored all fonts
* Moved new dungeon/build/slot/event buttons to the top of the page
* New background, banner and menu styles
* All regular user pages styled (tabs now working)

### To do
* Sign up for event link/page not working yet
* Sort dropdown incomplete
* Filter slot links not working yet
* Validate/minimize all css

### Other ideas
* Builds page needs create event links?
* Officer page
    * Show leader/officers (specify guild?)
    * Only admin can add/remove leadership role?
* Invite page
    * Request an invite
    * Invite status page (pending [full guild/alliance status?], invited, rejected because of name/guild membership)
    * Show invites to leadership only?
    * Show history of invites (last ~10-15 only?), who invited, what guild?
